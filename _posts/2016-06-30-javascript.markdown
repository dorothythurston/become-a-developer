Many developers complain about JavaScript. Like Ruby, it is an an object-oriented computer programming language, but is commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. JavaScript was originally developed in 10 days in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, while he was working for Netscape Communications Corporation. Whether you end up loving it or hating it, it has been pervasive. It provides extra functionality and is often supplemental to HTML & CSS or used in tandem. There are also larger popular frameworks for front-end functionality such as <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a> which was developed by Google and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a> which is maintained by Facebook. You can learn those too, but now lets look at using a very popular smaller library called <a href="https://jquery.com/jQuery">jQuery</a>.
