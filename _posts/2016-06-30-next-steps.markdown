So you're a web development wizard now right? Of course! but one of the best parts of this industry is there is always more to learn. Here are some futher that you should check out:

Testing track on Upcase. I cannot recommend this enough. Testing is super important! Also, any other Rails track or Ruby track on Upcase. This site was put together by <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/">thoughbot</a> which is considered one of the best (if not the best) Ruby on Rails consultancies in the world.

</ul>

Further online resources for learning:
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">https://www.codeschool.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">https://www.thinkful.com/</a></li>
</ul>

Looking for a deeper learning or more guided learning option? Consider taking online courses, and even attending a bootcamp. FYI If you have made it through all of the previous coursework you have learned most of what is taught at Ruby on Rails immersive bootcamps, and a larger part of what is taught at front-end Web development bootcamps.

In person bootcamps:
