The command line is another way to communicate with your computer. If you think of scenes in movies where a person is "hacking" a computer likely the scene features someone entering commands in a terminal prompt. The files and folders on your screen are just a pretty display of the information that is on your computer. The command line is a different way to instruct your computer to do actions you'd like it to do instead of clicking and dragging things about.
