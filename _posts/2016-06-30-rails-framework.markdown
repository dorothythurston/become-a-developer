Rails web application framework written in Ruby for building web applications that provides default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. I like to think of it as assembled pieces of legos. In this metaphor Ruby is the legos themselves. Think of Rails as pre built lego parts. It is all just lego pieces, it is all just ruby code (well, okay and some other bits but don't worry about that for now) and then your snap it together! And bam, a website!

Now that I have thoroughly confused you... Hopefully these resources can straighten you out. FYI this tutorial by Michael Hartl is legendary. Many Rails developers started learning Rails with it.
