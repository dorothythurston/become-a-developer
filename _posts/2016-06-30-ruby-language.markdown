Ruby is a programming language that was designed and developed in the mid 1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. Matsumoto has said that Ruby is designed for programmer productivity and fun. At a Google Tech Talk in 2008 Matsumoto further stated, "I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language." Ruby is said to follow the principle of least astonishment, meaning that the language should behave in such a way as to minimize confusion for experienced users. Matsumoto has said his primary design goal was to make a language that he himself enjoyed using, by minimizing programmer work and possible confusion

What does all that mean for you? It means ruby is your friend, and it has been designed to be easier for you to learn and use. What do you think this does...?
